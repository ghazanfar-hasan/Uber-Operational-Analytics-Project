Before analysis, the dataset will undergo a thorough cleaning process to address issues such

● Handling missing values in critical columns (e.g., fare, ride_id, population).
● Resolving duplicate records.
● Ensuring data consistency across tables (e.g., matching driver ratings with actual ride data)*/
